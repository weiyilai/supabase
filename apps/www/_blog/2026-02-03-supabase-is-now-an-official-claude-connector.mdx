The Supabase MCP server is now listed on Claude's official connectors. Connect your Supabase projects to Claude and manage your entire database infrastructure by telling Claude what you need.

With the Supabase MCP server, you can execute SQL queries, modify schemas, deploy edge functions, manage branches, and troubleshoot your projects without leaving your conversation with Claude.

Ask Claude to check security advisors on your project and fix any issues. Request a schema change and Claude executes it. Deploy an edge function with a single prompt.
