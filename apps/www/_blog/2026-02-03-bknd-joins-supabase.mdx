We're excited to welcome Dennis Senn, creator of [BKND](https://bknd.io), to the Supabase team.

Dennis brings experience building lightweight backends and developer-first tooling into our ecosystem. The focus isn't to immediately integrate BKND into Supabase. Instead, Dennis will be working on a Supabase Lite offering, designed specifically for agentic workloads.

### Lite, but not rushed

There's a lot of excitement around building agentic systems. The right shape for a "Supabase Lite" offering is still a work-in-progress and we want to get it right. This move is about Dennis's expertise and collaboration, not a product announcement. We'll share more as the development progresses. Some ideas include:

- A trimmed-down experience for sandboxes.
- Databases architectures for agentic workloads.
- Smaller, cheaper, simpler databases.

### Next Steps

BKND will stay open source. We will work in a separate repo to explore how to best build a lightweight Supabase experience. We're excited for what's to come and welcome any ideas as we build.
