AI coding tools have made prototyping almost instant. Agencies now send working demos to clients within minutes of a kickoff call. But speed creates new risks: databases with no row-level security, permissions that break under load, and prototypes that fall apart the moment they hit production.

Join agency leaders and Supabase as they share how top agencies balance velocity with control. Learn when to let AI move fast, and where experienced developers still need to step in.

## Key takeaways

- Why leading agencies design database schemas and RLS policies before touching the UI

- When to use visual AI builders for speed vs code-first tools for control

- How to prevent AI tools from making breaking changes to production environments

- Lightweight validation practices that preserve velocity without sacrificing safety

- How to hand projects off to clients without handing over production risk
