If you encounter the error: `'invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0x00'` when attempting to access your project's [Triggers](/dashboard/project/_/database/triggers) or [Webhooks](/dashboard/project/_/database/webhooks) via the dashboard, it indicates that the `standard_conforming_strings` database setting is currently `off`.

This setting, when `off`, can cause issues with how certain character sequences are interpreted by Postgres, leading to errors in dashboard queries that expect UTF8-compliant strings.

To resolve this issue:

1.  Connect to your database instance using the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql/new) in the Dashboard or a client like `psql`.
2.  Execute the following SQL command:
    ```sql
    ALTER DATABASE postgres SET standard_conforming_strings = on;
    ```
3.  Allow a few minutes for this setting to take effect, as existing pooled connections might retain the previous configuration. If the error persists after this period, a database restart may be necessary.
