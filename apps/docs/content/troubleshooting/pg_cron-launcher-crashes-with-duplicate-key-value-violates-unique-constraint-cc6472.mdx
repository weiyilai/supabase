The `pg_cron` launcher process crashes approximately every minute, displaying the error `'duplicate key value violates unique constraint "job_run_details_pkey"'`.

## Why does this happen?

This issue occurs when the `cron.runid_seq` sequence is out of sync with the `cron.job_run_details` table. The sequence attempts to generate `runid` values that already exist in the table, leading to a unique key violation. This is typically due to the sequence's last value not being correctly aligned with the maximum `runid` already present in the table.

## How to resolve this

To resolve this, you need to reset the `cron.job_run_details` table. If data preservation is required, ensure you back up its contents before proceeding.

Execute the following SQL command via the [SQL editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql/new):
`TRUNCATE cron.job_run_details;`
