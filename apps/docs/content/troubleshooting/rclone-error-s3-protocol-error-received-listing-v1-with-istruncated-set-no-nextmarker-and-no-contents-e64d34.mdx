When attempting to list objects from a Supabase bucket using `rclone lsf`, you might encounter the error: `'s3 protocol error: received listing v1 with IsTruncated set, no NextMarker and no Contents'`.

## Why this happens

This issue arises because `rclone` defaults to using S3 List API Version 1. This version may not correctly handle large, paginated bucket listings when interacting with Supabase Storage.

## How to resolve this

To resolve this, explicitly instruct `rclone` to use S3 List API Version 2. This can be done by adding the `--s3-list-version 2` flag to your `rclone lsf` command.

Example:
`rclone lsf supabase:bucket-name --s3-list-version 2`
