If PostgREST is returning errors by not recognizing new database columns, tables, views or functions, and logging errors similar to:

```console
24/Dec/2025:18:16:33 -0500: Failed listening for database notifications on the "pgrst" channel. ERROR:  could not access status of transaction 12037872 DETAIL:  Could not open file "pg_xact/000B": No such file or directory.
```

Then this indicates that there's a stale PostgREST schema cache.

## Why this happens

This can occur when an [underlying Postgres notification queue issue](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAK98qZ3wZLE-RZJN_Y%2BTFjiTRPPFPBwNBpBi5K5CU8hUHkzDpw%40mail.gmail.com) prevents PostgREST from receiving cache reload signals after schema changes.

## How to fix this

Execute the following SQL command via the [SQL Editor](/dashboard/project/_/sql/new) or a direct client:

```sql
select pg_notification_queue_usage();
```

This command directly refreshes the Postgres notification queue, prompting PostgREST to update its schema cache with the latest database schema. This process is non-disruptive and does not require a database instance or PostgREST service restart.
