## Building the app

Start building the React app from scratch.

### Initialize a React app

Use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to initialize an app called `supabase-react`:

```bash
npm create vite@latest supabase-react -- --template react
cd supabase-react
```

Install the only additional dependency: [supabase-js](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js).

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

And finally, save the environment variables in a `.env.local` file.
Use the Project URL and the key that you copied [earlier](#get-api-details).

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/react-user-management/.env.example"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=.env"
/>

With the API credentials in place, create a helper file to initialize the Supabase client. These variables will be exposed
on the browser, and that's fine as you have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/auth#row-level-security) enabled on the Database.

Create and edit `src/supabaseClient.js`:

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/react-user-management/src/supabaseClient.js"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/supabaseClient.js"
/>

### App styling (optional)

An optional step is to update the CSS file `src/index.css` to make the app look nice.
You can find the full contents of this file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supabase/supabase/master/examples/user-management/react-user-management/src/index.css).

### Set up a login component

Create a React component to manage logins and sign-ups. It uses Magic Links, so users can sign in with their email without using passwords.

Create and edit `src/Auth.jsx`:

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/react-user-management/src/Auth.jsx"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/Auth.jsx"
/>

### Account page

Users also need a way to edit their profile details and manage their accounts after signing in.

### Create an upload widget

Every Supabase project is configured with [Storage](/docs/guides/storage) for managing large files like photos and videos.

Create an avatar for the user so that they can upload a profile photo. Start by creating a new component:

Create and edit `src/Avatar.jsx`:

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/react-user-management/src/Avatar.jsx"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/Avatar.jsx"
/>

After a user is signed in, allow them to edit their profile details and manage their account.

Create a new component for that called `src/Account.jsx` and also add the `Avatar` component created earlier.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/react-user-management/src/Account.jsx"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/Account.jsx"
/>

### Launch!

Now that you have all the components in place, update `src/App.jsx`, which fetches the current user via the [`getUser`](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-getuser) method if there is an existing session. This method performs a network request to the Supabase Auth server.

<$CodeSample
path="/user-management/react-user-management/src/App.jsx"
lines={[[1, -1]]}
meta="name=src/App.jsx"
/>

Once that's done, run this in a terminal window:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And then open the browser to [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you should see the completed app.

At this stage you have a fully functional application!
